TODO:

- Fix google search api so that the agents can access live data (weather, plane tickets)

- Add a task, and possibly an agent? that is in charge of taking the crew output,
  formatting it, and placing the formatted output nicely into a new google docs. 
  - possible feature, if you are running the same prompt, just edit the previously opened google docs.
